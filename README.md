google-homepage is a mock-up of the Google homepage.

Skills Demonstrated
For HTML in this project, I used unordered lists to create the top navigation bar and footer, buttons, and an input text field. For CSS, I styled the page using ID selectors, some classes, and the hover property.

Self-Reflection
To me, creating the HTML is easy though sometimes I'm not sure when to associate something as a class or an ID. Being able to style the page correctly is pretty difficult--I had to do a lot of googling to achieve that results that I wanted. There are definitely better ways to create the navigation bar and footer, especially without the use of lists. Also, getting the icon into the search bar was difficult as well. I'll be sure to think of different ways to create them in the future.
